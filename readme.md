A carefully curated collection of tools, datasets, papers, and open-source implementations focused on Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) and its realism-driven extension, Realistic Artificial Data (RAD) â€” a paradigm that moves beyond superficial resemblance toward causally grounded, physically consistent, and privacy-safe data generation.

This repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge hub for researchers and practitioners exploring the intersection of simulation, generative modeling, and causal inference in data-centric AI.

Synthetic Data Generation has evolved from simple statistical mimicry to hybrid frameworks that combine simulation, physical modeling, and generative AI to capture the true mechanisms of data creation. RAD extends SDG by embedding causal structures, measurement physics, and domain constraints, ensuring that artificial datasets not only look real but also behave realistically under domain shifts, privacy audits, and safety analyses.

By consolidating the state of the art, this collection bridges theory and practice, illustrating how realism-aware synthetic data can enable reproducible, privacy-preserving, and trustworthy machine learning systems.
